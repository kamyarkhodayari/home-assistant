# Hardware

[Return to Home](index.md)

or the hardware, I went with:

- Raspberry Pi 4 model B 4GB RAM - [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B09TTNF8BT?tag=pinest-20)
- Raspberry Pi 4 USB-C Power Supply EU Plug - [Buy on Amazon]()
- 5-inch Touchscreen display (800 × 480) - [Buy on Amazon]()

I picked the 4 GB RAM version of the Pi 4 because I’m planning to run everything in Docker containers, and I was worried that less RAM might not cut it with all the features I’m adding.

> **Mistake 1**: I didn’t realize that the Raspberry Pi doesn’t come with internal storage for the OS. I forgot to buy an SD card! Make sure to add one to your cart so you don’t run into the same issue.
