# Introduction

With IoT devices getting smarter, I wanted to solve a few everyday challenges:

- **Weather:** Living in the Netherlands, you always need to know if you'll need an umbrella or warmer clothes. I always forget to check the forecast on my phone—it’s just too much effort. I wanted something on my desk that shows the weather at a glance, no phone or laptop needed.

- **Spotify:** As a Spotify addict, especially on Linux, it’s a hassle to see what's playing, skip tracks, or add songs to my playlist. I didn’t want to dedicate screen space to Spotify or constantly open the app. I needed something more convenient that’s always visible.

- **Customizable Design:** I wanted to build something entirely my own, with a design focused on the features I care about most. Instead of settling for off-the-shelf solutions, I wanted the flexibility to shape it around my needs and add new functionalities as I go—like controlling smart lights or other devices from my desk.

So, instead of buying a Google Nest 2, I decided to create a DIY solution that fits my needs. I’m documenting everything so you can build your own version, customized just how you like. This project is open source—feel free to fork it, tweak the software, add new features, or contribute your own ideas.

I’ll focus on making everything easy, beginner-friendly, and affordable. Since I’m new to building physical products with hardware, I’ll also share my struggles and what I’ve learned, so you can avoid the same issues.
