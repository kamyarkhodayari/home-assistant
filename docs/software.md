## Installing the OS on Raspberry Pi

First things first, you need to install an operating system on your Pi. And for that, you'll need a microSD card.

1. **Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager on your PC**  
   Raspberry Pi Imager makes it super easy to install Raspberry Pi OS (or other OS options) onto your microSD card, so it's ready to go with your Pi.

2. **Connect your microSD card to the PC**  
   Open up Raspberry Pi Imager, choose your Pi model (Raspberry Pi 4 in this case), select your OS (I'll be using Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit), and choose your storage (the microSD card you just connected).

   Follow the prompts, click "NEXT," and wait for the setup to finish. Once it’s done, safely eject your microSD card.

3. **Insert the microSD card into the Pi**  
   Pop the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi. You'll need an external monitor, and ideally a mouse, keyboard, and USB-C power supply. Don’t forget a micro HDMI adapter to connect the Pi to your screen. Plug in the micro HDMI and power, and wait for the boot screen to show up on your external display.  

   Once the Raspberry Pi OS desktop environment appears on the screen, you're all set! Your Pi is ready to go.

4. **Install the 5-inch Display**  
   For details on setting up the 5-inch display, check out the [Hardware](hardware.md) section.
